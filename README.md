Hangman is an old-school favorite, a word game where the goal is simply to find the missing word or words Python terminal game, which runs in the Code Institute mock terminal on Heroku.

As Part of the project 3, I have choosen this game show my skills and my knowladge on python.

# Technology


*  This game was created with:

    * [Gitpod](https://www.gitpod.io/) used to develop a project and organise version control 

    * [Github](https://github.com) used to host repository
       
    * [Heroku](https://id.heroku.com/login) used to deploy my application

* [Lucid](https://lucid.app/users/login#/login) used to create the flowchart for the project.

* The Code Institute's GitHub [python-essentials-template](https://github.com/Code-Institute-Org/python-essentials-template) for Python is used in order for the program to display properly in the deployed site on Heroku.

* [random](https://docs.python.org/3/library/random.html) to randomize anagram

* [time](https://docs.python.org/3/library/time.html) to slow down printed statements

* [Python 3](https://www.python.org/) - an interpreted high-level general-purpose backend programming language.
